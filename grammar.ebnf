(* JACKAL formal grammar by spsandwichman 

    all words in UPPERCASE are jackal keywords. 
    {} indicates repetition (0 or more)
    [] indicates optionals (0 or 1)
    () indicates grouping
    things like "ident" and "literal" are not defined here but are assumed to exist

    some things like nested function decls, PUBLIC/EXPORT declarations in functions, etc.
    will be parsed as valid but eliminated during a semantic analysis phase.
