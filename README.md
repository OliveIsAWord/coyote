# coyote

`coyote` is a **VERY work-in-progress** alternative implementation of the [Jackal](https://github.com/xrarch/newsdk) programming language by [hyenasky](https://github.com/hyenasky). It's currently just a testing ground and will be fully written in [Mars](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars) once the self-hosted compiler is complete. 

`coyote` focuses on both comptime efficency and runtime performance, using the [Iron compiler backend](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars) for higher optimization compared to the official implementation.
