# coyote

`coyote` is a **work-in-progress** alternative implementation of the [Jackal](https://github.com/xrarch/newsdk) programming language by [hyenasky](https://github.com/hyenasky).
`coyote` focuses on both comptime efficency and runtime performance, acheiving lower memory usage, faster compile times, and higher quality code generation compared to the official implementation.
